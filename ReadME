Simple Poker Simulator 4/12/2020

Overview: Running this simulation will provide the user a poker hand (two cards), followed by dealing a flop, followed by the turn card, followed by the river card. This program DOES NOT evaluate the hand ‘Value’ and there are no opponents. 

Approach: 
I.	Build deck of cards with list 
II.	Build hand containing two random elements from the deck. 
III.	Build flop_deck with the two cards from hand removed. 
IV.	From flop_deck take three cards and display them
V.	Build new deck turn_deck with flop_deck – flop_cards  
VI.	From turn_deck draw one turn card
VII.	Build new deck river_deck with river_deck – turn cards
VIII.	From river_deck draw one river card 

Alternative approaches: 
An alternative approach involves looping through the hand and comparing values in hand vs. flop, hand + flop vs. turn, hand + flop +turn  vs. river to make sure there are no duplicate card values. 

Improvements:
I.	Add GUI elements (Pygame maybe?) 
II.	Simulate player betting/folding options 
III.	Add value of hands (not sure how to do this maybe classes?) 
      a.	Expanding on this: Display pot odds and the number of outs the players hand has
